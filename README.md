# 100roku_accounts_automation
automation for create 100 accounts on roku's website

if you need to create 100 roku accounts, you found the code.

Wrote in Python, my code can automatically create 100 accounts.

it was tested in brazil's roku website and works only on it, i used an USA vpn and the website template was different, so, the program didn't worked.

if you want to use it, be sure to change the "mail" template with yours on "testmail.app", and connect to a brazil server with your vpn.
